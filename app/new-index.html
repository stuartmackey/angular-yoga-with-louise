            <h2>Welcome to Yoga With Louise.</h2>

            <p>If you are looking for a yoga class in Belfast City Centre, or the surrounding area, you've come to the right place. I have been offering classes in Belfast, Comber, Saintfield and Lisburn since 2008, and with my own unique style of teaching make yoga accessible to all. I specialise in helping you bring yoga into your everyday life, and to this end, offer classes to the very young in my Parent and Children Classes to Chair Yoga for the less mobile, and everything in between.</p> 
            <p> Please feel free to browse the range of <a href="#classes">classes</a>. Hopefully you will find something that suits you and if not, don't hesitate to get in touch and suggest another time, venue or class style!</p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Beginners Yoga</h3> 
        <p>A class specially designed to introduce yoga to those with no experience.  The classic poses are studied in a relaxed and friendly class, dispelling all myths that yoga is only for the abnormally bendy!</p>
                          
        <h3>Continuation Yoga</h3> 
        <p>Designed for those with a little more experience, with deeper and more challenging posture work, breathing exercises and relaxation.</p> 

        <h3>Parent and Child Yoga</h3> 
        <p>Designed to promote and nurture the bond between parents and children, in a fun and non-competitive environment.  Some poses can be practiced as individuals where each person is encouraged to 'be the best they can', whilst others will need the help and support of the parent (or child!). Aimed at children from 2 - 9 years of age, although this is flexible. </p> 
          
        <h3>Kids Yoga</h3> 
        <p>When a child feels they are ready to join a yoga class on their own, this is the one for them.  Still taught in a relaxed manner, the class is designed to promote self-confidence at a difficult and emotional time in a child's life.  Aimed at 10 - 16 year olds.</p> 

        <h3>Chair based yoga exercises</h3> 
        <p>Specifically designed for the chair bound or those with problems standing for long periods of time, this class covers many of the anti-arthritic series of movements as well as some fun yoga games.  Aimed primarily at nursing/residential home situations, this class can be arranged for any group environment.</p>

        <h4>Now offering Indian Head Massage therapy.</h4>
        <p>I am pleased to announce that I am now able to offer Indian Head
        Massage treatments. Indian Head Massage is a non-intrusive massage,
        performed on the neck, head and face, using only the natural oils in
        the skin - making it an ideal treatment for any time of the day, or
        for those who don't like oil being used as in traditional massage.</p>

        <p>Indian head massage helps increase joint mobility and flexibility in
        the neck and shoulders, improves blood circulation and lymphatic flow,
        frees knots of muscular tension, relaxes connective tissue, and aids
        in the elimination of accumulated toxins and waste products. It is
        particularly good for reducing the effects of stress and tension.</p>

        <p>A variety of techniques are used, including deep kneading of muscles
        in the neck, raking of the scalp and applying pressure to points on
        the face, all of which promote and stimulate new skin cell growth and
        healthy hair.</p>

        <p>The treatment is given with the client fully clothed, seated in a
        chair meaning it can be done anywhere, at any time.</p>

        <p>Open to both yoga clients and non-yoga clients, treatments can last
        between 20 and 45 mins, and a variety of appointment times are
        available.</p>

        <p>Please contact me by <a href="#contact">email</a> or text for prices or any other information.</p>
